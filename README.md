This is a functioning E-commerce full stack project I made while learning MERN stack.
https://biologybagshopapp.herokuapp.com/
It is a shop where you can:

- Browse through products
- Search bar for products
- Products Review and RATINGS (limited to one/product for each user)
- Pagination
- Make a PASSWORD protected profile to place an order

  <div>⚡ Choose products, they are added to your cart</div>
  <div>⚡Proceed with order, filling up details, shipping address etc.</div>
  <div>⚡Pay for order</div>
  <div>(PayPal sandbox used with react-paypal-button-v2, yes still workable with React18)</div>
  <div>⚡Check your order history on your profile</div>
  <div>⚡Edit profile details including new password</div>

- Admin function

  <div>⚡Edit users, also make new admins</div>
  <div>⚡Edit products in the shop also add new products (including PICTURE UPLOAD)</div>
  <div>⚡Edit order status change it to Delivered</div>

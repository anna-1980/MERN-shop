This is a functioning E-commerce full stack project I made while learning MERN stack.
https://biologybagshopapp.herokuapp.com/
It is a shop where you can: 
- Browse through products
- Search bar for products
- Products Review and RATINGS (limited to one/product for each user)
- Pagination 
- Make a PASSWORD protected profile to place an order 
 o	Choose products, they are added to your cart
 o	Proceed with order, filling up details, shipping address etc.
 o	Pay for order 
 o	( PayPal sandbox used with react-paypal-button-v2, yes still workable with React18)
 o	Check your order history on your profile
 o	Edit profile details including new password
- Admin function 
 o	Edit users, also make new admins
 o	Edit products in the shop also add new products (including PICTURE UPLOAD)
 o	Edit order status change it to Delivered

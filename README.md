This is a functioning E-commerce full stack project I made while learning MERN stack.
https://biologybagshopapp.herokuapp.com/
It is a shop where you can: 
  - Browse through products
  - Search bar for products
  - Products Review and RATINGS (limited to one/product for each user)
  - Pagination 
  - Make a PASSWORD protected profile to place an order 
    > Choose products, they are added to your cart
    > Proceed with order, filling up details, shipping address etc.
    > Pay for order 
    (PayPal sandbox used with react-paypal-button-v2, yes still workable with React18)
    > Check your order history on your profile
    > Edit profile details including new password
  - Admin function 
    > Edit users, also make new admins
    > Edit products in the shop also add new products (including PICTURE UPLOAD)
    > Edit order status change it to Delivered

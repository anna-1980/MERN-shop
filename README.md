This is a functioning E-commerce full stack project I made while learning MERN stack.
https://biologybagshopapp.herokuapp.com/
It is a shop where you can:

- Browse through products
- Search bar for products
- Products Review and RATINGS (limited to one/product for each user)
- Pagination
- Make a PASSWORD protected profile to place an order
  &gt; Choose products, they are added to your cart
  &gt; Proceed with order, filling up details, shipping address etc.
  &gt; Pay for order
  (PayPal sandbox used with react-paypal-button-v2, yes still workable with React18)
  &gt; Check your order history on your profile
  &gt; Edit profile details including new password
- Admin function
  &gt; Edit users, also make new admins
  &gt; Edit products in the shop also add new products (including PICTURE UPLOAD)
  &gt; Edit order status change it to Delivered

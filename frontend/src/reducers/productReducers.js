// reducer takes 2 things, the initial STATE and an ACTION
//when you create an ACTION reducer you gonna dispatch action to this reducer
//ACTION might also have a payload with the data we fetched formt eh server
//initial state for the products is an empty array: state = { products: []}
// then we eveluate the type that is in the action object so we use switch for that
// 3 types of actions 1) product list request - when we make fetch request 2) product List sucess when we get sucessful response and we get the data 3) fails - sent an error throught the state
//we gonna fill the product state with that payload : products: action.payload  
//the switch/case cases are usually put in a constants variable bacause they should not change new file in src = constants
